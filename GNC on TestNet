How to get GNC on Test Net


First of all, Thank you very much to participate GNC token sale. We have recently publish our smart contract at https://github.com/gncnetwork/
smartContract. Below is the tutorial how to test and get GNC on the test network.

Step 1
Download MetaMask chrome extension to generate a wallet. This is going to be the owner of the smart contract. Alternatively you can always use Mist or My Ether Wallet. For the sake of simplicity let's use MetaMask extension in this project.
Once you download the extension, go ahead and create a new account protected by a password. Then choose "Ropsten TestNet" from the top left corner. Before we deploy the contract to Main Ethereum blockchain, we'll test it against TestNet and make sure everything works as expected. It looks something like this

Step 2 
Ask GNC for some ETH on testnet. Email “give me some ETH” to yang.chen.sv@gmail.com


Step 3 
发送 0.5个 ETH 到 GNC的智能合约 0xFF58C66D157B38964eBb3D52ED1Ff4
